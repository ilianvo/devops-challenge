# Notify & Deploy DevOps Challenge

This repository contains a DevOps automation setup that sends notifications to an API via a Docker container, built and versioned through GitHub Actions, and provisioned locally using Terraform. The solution demonstrates Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization.

## Summary

The project fulfills the following requirements:





Notification Script: A Python script (notification.py) sends a POST request to https://varengold.io/notification with a JSON payload containing a timestamp, image version, and custom variable.



Docker: A Dockerfile packages the script into a lightweight container based on python:3.12-slim.



CI/CD: A GitHub Actions workflow (ci.yml) builds, tags, and pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub on every push to the main branch, automatically incrementing the patch version (e.g., v1.0.0 â†’ v1.0.1).


Terraform: Infrastructure as Code provisions and runs the Docker container locally using the Docker provider.



Execution: The container runs the notification script on start, sending the API request.


## Tools Chosen


Python: Selected for the notification script due to its simplicity, robust requests library for HTTP calls, and cross-platform compatibility.



Docker: Ensures a consistent, reproducible environment for running the script, simplifying deployment.



GitHub Actions: Chosen for CI/CD due to its seamless integration with GitHub, ease of configuration, and free tier for public repositories.



Terraform with Docker Provider: Enables declarative infrastructure management for local container provisioning, aligning with Infrastructure as Code principles.



Docker Hub: Used as the image registry for its widespread adoption and straightforward integration with GitHub Actions.

## How to Run Locally

Prerequisites


Docker: Installed and running.



Terraform: Installed (version compatible with Docker provider ~> 3.0).



GitHub Account: With a repository set up.



Docker Hub Account: With a repository named notify-deploy (or update the repository name in ci.yml and main.tf).



GitHub Secrets: Configure DOCKERHUB_USERNAME (your Docker Hub username) and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN (a Docker Hub access token).
